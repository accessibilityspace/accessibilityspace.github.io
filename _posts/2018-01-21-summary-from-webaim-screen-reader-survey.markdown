    <h2 class="post-section-title">The 2017 edition is out <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey7/" target="_blank">now</a></h2>
    <p class="post-paragraph">This is the 7th edition of the survey that started in 2009.</p>

    <p class="post-paragraph">
        Followed somewhat closely by <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/" target="_blank">NVDA</a> with a <strong class="post-paragraph-fact">31.9%</strong> of participants and <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/accessibility/mac/vision/" target="_blank">VoiceOver</a> with <strong class="post-paragraph-fact">11.7%</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="post-paragraph">
        However, this is <em>only</em> the main screen reader surveyed users use. The next stats help see the big picture better I believe.

    <h2 class="post-section-title">So... which screen readers do they commonly use?</h2>
     <div class="post-fact-container">
        <p class="post-fact">66%</p>
        <em>Participant percentage who use <a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/Blindness/JAWS" target="_blank">JAWS</a> commonly</em>
    </div>
    <div class="post-fact-container">
        <p class="post-fact">64.9%</p>
        <em>Participant percentage who use <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/" target="_blank">NVDA</a> commonly</em>
    </div>
    <p class="post-paragraph">
        Here we can see the clear tie there is between these two in terms of usage.
    </p>
    <div class="post-fact-container">
        <p class="post-fact post-fact-alternate-color">39.6%</p>
        <em>Participant percentage who use <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/accessibility/mac/vision/" target="_blank">VoiceOver</a> commonly</em>
    </div>
    <p class="post-paragraph">
        This seems to point to the fact that VoiceOver is used a lot as a secondary screen reader. It's also relevant to mention that <strong class="post-paragraph-fact">68%</strong> of the respondents use more than one screen reader.

    <h2 class="post-section-title">Browsers</h2>
    <p class="post-paragraph">
        When it comes to screen readers though, it's not only a matter of the tool you choose. It is also important under what operating system it is running and what web browser it's being used with. Next, we can see which are the most commonly found combinations.
