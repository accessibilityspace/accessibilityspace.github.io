    <p class="post-paragraph">VoiceOver is a full-featured screen reader built into macOS (and iOS) that speaks the text in documents and windows, and describes aloud what appears on your screen.</p> 
    <p class="post-paragraph">The following instructions are for the <strong>Desktop</strong> version of VoiceOver.</p>
</section>
<section class="post-section">
    <h2 class="post-section-title">First steps</h2>
    <p class="post-paragraph">Be ready to "annoy" your neighbours! Seriously, VoiceOver is chatty, especially when not configured. Be mindful of your surroundings and use headphones and/or lower the volume on your device :)</p> 
    <p class="post-paragraph">You can start and stop VoiceOver with <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> (you might need to use <kbd>Fn</kbd> key).</p>
</section>
<section class="post-section">
    <h2 class="post-section-title">Okay, so how do I move now?</h2>
    <p class="post-paragraph">VoiceOver uses the "VoiceOver keys" or <kbd>VO</kbd> keys extensively. Any upcoming reference to <kbd>VO</kbd> + <kbd>someKey</kbd> will be referencing those keys.</p> 
    <p class="post-paragraph">The VoiceOver keys (<kbd>VO</kbd>) are <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> (note, NOT <kbd>Command</kbd>)</p>
    <p class="post-paragraph">Now that we know the <kbd>VO</kbd> keys, let's see the shortcuts for some basic actions:</p>
    <table class="post-table">
        <tr>
            <th>Action</th>
            <th>Keys</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Hear summary of webpage</td>
            <td><kbd>VO</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Read previous item</td>
            <td><kbd>VO</kbd> + <kbd><-</kbd></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Read next item</td>
            <td><kbd>VO</kbd> + <kbd>-></kbd></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Activate a link or form control</td>
            <td><kbd>VO</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p class="post-paragraph"><em>You can still use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to navigate like if you were not using a Screen Reader</em></p>
    <p class="post-paragraph">Beyond these really basic actions, there are more specific actions that also were mentioned to me by some of the amazing disabled users of Doodle. You could for instance, go the the next link, or form control, or list. My assumption is that power users of Screen Readers use those once they have the topology of the site in their heads.</p>
    <p class="post-paragraph">The next actions can be combined with <kbd>Shift</kbd> to go to the <em>previous</em> occurrence.</p>
    <table class="post-table">
        <tr>
            <th>Action</th>
            <th>Keys</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Go to next link</td>
            <td><kbd>VO</kbd> + <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Go to next heading</td>
            <td><kbd>VO</kbd> + <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Go to next form control</td>
            <td><kbd>VO</kbd> + <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd></td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2 class="post-section-title">But I can't remember so many combinations... :(</h2>
    <p class="post-paragraph">If you're lost at any point, you can hear the VoiceOver command for a key. In order to do this press <kbd>VO</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>. This will start the keyboard help. You can stop it by pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd></p>
    <p class="post-paragraph">When in this mode, hold the <kbd>VO</kbd> keys and press some modifier to know what action corresponds to this key combination.</p> 
    <p class="post-paragraph">For instance, try pressing <kbd>VO</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> to hear “Control-Option-D Go to Dock Moves VoiceOver cursor to the Dock.”</p> 
    <p class="post-paragraph">Try also exploring the <em>Commands menu</em> VoiceOver command (<kbd>VO</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd>)</p> 
    <p class="post-paragraph">Some other interesting commands available are:</p>
    <table class="post-table">
        <tr>
            <th>Action</th>
            <th>Keys</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Open VoiceOver utility </td>
            <td><kbd>VO</kbd> + <kbd>F8</kbd></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Open Commands menu</td>
            <td><kbd>VO</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Go to browser bar </td>
            <td><kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Navigate through browser menus</td>
            <td><kbd>VO</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd></td>

    <h2 class="post-section-title">Is VoiceOver too chatty?</h2>
    <p class="post-paragraph">Since VoiceOver is <em>very verbose</em> by default, you might want to configure the tool itself.</p>
    <p class="post-paragraph">By pressing <kbd>VO</kbd> + <kbd>F8</kbd> you will open the "VoiceOver utility" where you can change the voice it uses, the speed, tweak how verbose the tool is per type of element, and many many options more.</p>

<section class="post-section">
    <h2 class="post-section-title">Are you stuck somewhere?</h2>
    <p class="post-paragraph">This might sound obvious, but try listening to the explanation VoiceOver gives you about the item you're focused on. It might be conveying the combination of keys that you need to press in order to continue navigating the site. Sometimes you may be "trapped" in a content area or group just because you have to get in/out of it (<kbd>VO</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>ArrowUp/Down</kbd>)</p>

<p class="post-paragraph">If you still want to know more, here is the <a href="https://help.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/10.12/" target="_blank">Apple reference for VoiceOver</a>. It contains more commands, and more detailed explanations along with other functionalities the tool provides such as the <em>rotor controls</em>.</p>
